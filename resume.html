                <h2>Profil Professionnel</h2>
                <p>I am a first-year student in Networks and Telecommunications with a passion for network administration and computer science in general.
                    This beginning of my studies has allowed me to master the configuration of Cisco routers and switches, virtualization tools like VMware,
                    as well as basic knowledge in networking and programming in the terminal under both Windows and Linux. My goal is to graduate from this program
                    and later aim for an engineering school or work in network administration. My adaptability allows me to adjust to different work environments,
                    which is essential in a constantly evolving field. My sense of rigor is a major asset to ensure the quality and reliability of the work produced.
                    Moreover, my analytical skills allow me to understand the issues at hand and find solutions to solve them.</p>

                <h2>Expériences</h2>
                <h4>Employé d'étage</h4>
                <h5>Hôtel La Ferme du Lac Thyez, 550 Av. Louis Coppel, 74300 Thyez</h5>
                <ul class="ulexp">
                    <li>Cleaning the floors and rooms in teams, assisting guests in the hotel.</li>
                </ul>
                    <p>This experience, completed over two Augusts in different years, taught me how to manage my time effectively to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously while maintaining high quality. 
                    Working in a team in the hotel environment allowed me to develop my communication and collaboration skills, which will be very useful for project management and solving technical issues. 
                    Finally, organizing tasks and managing resources in the hospitality industry allowed me to optimize and maximize the efficiency of the service provided, 
                    teaching me how to manage teamwork and resource allocation effectively.</p>
                <h4>Job autour de chez moi</h4>
                <h5>Neighborhood</h5>
                <ul class="ulexp">
                    <li>Outdoor maintenance, pet sitting.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Before turning 16 and being allowed to work, I personally reached out to my neighbors to help with tasks during their absence or when necessary. 
                    This experience greatly improved my responsibility and autonomy, helped me communicate with clients and adapt my approach, 
                    and it also taught me the importance of reliability, an essential trait when working on IT projects where I need to ensure confidentiality and data security.</p>
